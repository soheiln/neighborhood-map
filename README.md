Neighborhood map app - Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project 5

Development Steps:
+ Get map and marker functionality to work
+ Add list view
+ update markers on map based on location
+ animation for active marker
+ clicking on list view activates its associated marker on map
+ implement search functionality for existing markers
+ show 3rd party info for current selection
+ Add additional functionality to open an infoWindow with the information described in step 7 when either a location is selected from the list view or its map marker is selected directly.

TODOs:
- Refactor code
- graceful handling of failed AJAX: if the data retrieval fails you indicate to the user that such a problem has occured. The user should not be left guessing why something is not working. To test the functionality of failed data requests you can simply disconnect from the internet.
- work on css
- app architecture: student hard coded at least 5 locations in their model (?)
- a README file is included detailing all the steps required to successfully run the application.
